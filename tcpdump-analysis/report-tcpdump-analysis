# Cybersecurity Incident Report: DNS Traffic Analysis

## Part 1: Summary of the Problem

Using the tcpdump log, we identified that the client machine attempted to resolve the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com` via DNS, using the UDP protocol. The DNS server responded with an ICMP error: `udp port 53 unreachable`. Port 53 is used by DNS services, so this suggests that the DNS server was either unavailable or not responding.

This issue was confirmed when customers reported receiving a “destination port unreachable” error while trying to visit the site. The repeated ICMP errors in the logs support this conclusion.

## Part 2: Analysis and Cause

The issue occurred around 1:24 p.m., confirmed by log timestamps. The UDP requests to the DNS server failed, and ICMP error messages were returned, indicating port 53 was not reachable.

The cause may be:
- The DNS server being down.
- Firewall blocking port 53.
- A Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting the DNS server.

## Next Steps

- Verify DNS server status and logs.
- Ensure firewall rules are not blocking DNS requests.
- Monitor for traffic spikes or suspicious activity.
