# Cybersecurity Incident Report: SYN Flood DoS Attack

## Part 1: Summary of the Problem

Using Wireshark logs, we identified a flood of TCP SYN packets from a suspicious IP (203.0.113.0) targeting port 443 on the web server. The server was overwhelmed and began dropping connections, as indicated by `RST, ACK` and `504 Gateway Timeout` responses.

## Part 2: Analysis and Cause

This was a classic SYN flood attack. The attacker sent numerous SYN requests but never completed the TCP handshake. This left the server with open half-connections, exhausting its resources.

Symptoms observed:
- Connection timeouts
- Reset packets
- Spike in SYN requests from one IP

## Remediation Steps

- Block the attacker's IP
- Implement SYN cookies or rate limiting
- Monitor for repeat traffic from similar IP blocks
